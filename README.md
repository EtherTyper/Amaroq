# On learning of an official client going out and my general lack of ongoing feature development and support, I am opting to make it official that this repo will no longer be supported. I wish all the best to the Mastodon team and I am glad I could be part of its history. 

The app will remain in the store for now, until either the Mastodon API or iOS itself changes in such a way that the app breaks.
Happy Tooting <3
